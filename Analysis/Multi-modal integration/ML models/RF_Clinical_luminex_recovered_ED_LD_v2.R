# Otherwise, R will recognise the value based on the first digit while ignoring log/exp values. 
# For instance, if MeanDecreaseAccuracy was in character format, rest_ecg_ST.T.abnorm will have the highest value as R recognises the first digit in 4.1293934444743e-05 and fails to recognise that e-05 renders that value close to 0.

#1- Measuring variable importance

# The randomForestExplainer generates more feature importance score than the randomForest package. 
# These scores generated by the randomForestExplainer::measure_importance function can be categorized into 3 types of feature importance score.

# 1.1- Measures of importance based on the structure of the forest which is not examine in the randomForest package.
# i) Mean_minimal_depth: Minimal depth for a variable in a tree equals to the depth of the node which splits on that variable and is the closest to the root of the tree. 
# If it is low then a lot of observations are divided into groups on the basis of this variable.
# ii) no_of_nodes: Usually, number of trees and number of nodes are the same if trees are shallow. The number of nodes contain similar information as the number of trees and p-values. Thus, no_of_tress and p_value are omitted in plot_importance_ggpairs graph (which will be described later).
# iii) no_of_trees
# iv) p_value: Number of nodes in which predictor X was used for splitting exceeds the theoretical number of successes if they were random, following the binomial distribution given.
# v) times_a_root: Measures of importance based on the decrease in predictive accuracy post variable perturbation

# 1.2- 
# i) accuracy_decrease: Use for classification problems. Same value as randomForest::importance(rf_model$fit, type=2)
# ii) mse_increase: Use for regression problems.

# 1.3- Measure of importance based on loss function
# i) gini_decrease Use for classifcation cases. Same value as randomForest::importance(rf_model$fit, type=1).
#ii) node_purity_increase: Use for regression cases. Measured by the decrease in sum of squares

library(randomForestExplainer)
impt_frame<-measure_importance(rf_model$fit)
impt_frame %>% head()

# 1.4- Plotting
# plot_multi_way_importance plots variable importance scores from importance_frame. 
# By default, the function plots scores measuring importance based on the structure of the forest, mean_min_depth against times_a_root. 
plot_multi_way_importance(impt_frame, no_of_labels = 10)

# plot_multi_way_importance can plot up to 3 feature importance scores using any of the three kinds of importance measurements.

plot_multi_way_importance(impt_frame, x_measure = "accuracy_decrease", y_measure = "gini_decrease", size_measure = "p_value", no_of_labels = 10)

# 1.5- Selecting optimal importance scores to plot

# There are many multi-way importance plots which one can create thus we need to identify which sub-set of importance scores will provide us with more helpful plots. 
# Examining the relationship between the importance measurements with plot_importance_ggpairs can assist us in identifying a sub-set of scores to use. 
# We can pick three scores that least agree with each other, points in plots which are most dispersed.

plot_importance_ggpairs(impt_frame)
plot_importance_rankings(impt_frame)

# 1.6- Variable depth
# Previously, we looked at various types of importance measures. 
# Now we are specifically examining the mean minimal depth in detail. 
# The distribution of the mean minimal depth allows us to appreciate the variable’s role in the random forest’s structure and prediction. 
# plot_min_depth_distribution plots the top ten variables according to mean minimal depth calculated using top trees. 
# The mean minimal depth can be calculated in 3 different ways in plot_min_depth_distribution using the mean_sample argument. 
# The calculation differs in the way they treat missing values that appear when a feature is not used for tree splitting. 
# As a result, the ranking of variables may change for each calculation.

# The mean minimal depth is indicated by a vertical bar with the mean value beside it. 
# The smaller the mean minimal depth, the more important the variable is and the higher up the y-axis the variable will be. 
# The rainbow gradient reveals the min and max minimal depth for each variable. 
# The bigger the proportion of minimal depth zero (red blocks), the more frequent the variable is the root of a tree. 
# The smaller the proportion of NA minimal depth (gray blocks), the more frequent the variable is used for splitting trees. 
# The range of the x-axis is from zero to the maximum number of trees for the feature.
md_frame <- min_depth_distribution(rf_model$fit)
plot_min_depth_distribution(md_frame, mean_sample = "top_trees") # default mean_sample arg 

# 1.7- Variable Interaction
# We will use the important_variables function to select the top 6 variables based on the following variable importance measurements, times_a_root and no_of_nodes.
vars<- important_variables(impt_frame, k = 6, measures = c("times_a_root", "no_of_nodes"))

# After identifying the top 6 variables, we can examine the interactions between the variables with the min_depth_interactions function.
# The interaction is reflected as the mean_min_depth which is the mean conditional minimal depth, where a variable is taken as a root node/root_variable and the mean minimal depth is calculated for the other variable. 
# The uncond_mean_min_depth represents the unconditional mean minimal depth of the variable which is the mean minimal depth of the variable without having a stipulated root variable. 
# This value is the same as the mean value seen on the vertical bar in plot_min_depth_distribution.
interactions_frame <- min_depth_interactions(rf_model$fit, vars)
plot_min_depth_interactions(interactions_frame)

# 1.8- Interactive variables and forest prediction

# We can further evaluate the variable interactions by plotting the probability of a prediction against the variables making up the interaction. 
# For instance we plot the probability of having heart disease against resting blood pressure rest_bp and ST depression duration during exercise test ex_STdepression_dur. 
# The interaction of these two variables are the most frequent interaction as seen in plot_min_depth_interactions. 
# We plot the forest prediction against interactive variables with plot_predict_interaction.
