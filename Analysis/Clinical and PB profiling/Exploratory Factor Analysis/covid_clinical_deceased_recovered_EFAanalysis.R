#2- The Factorability of the Data
X <- data[,-c(13)]
Y <- data[,13]

#2.1- KMO
#The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) used to measure sampling adequacy is a better measure of factorability.
KMO(r=cor(mydata))
#According to Kaiser’s (1974) guidelines, a suggested cutoff for determining the factorability of the sample data is KMO ≥ 60.
#The total KMO is 0.65, indicating that, based on this test, we can probably conduct a factor analysis.

#2.2- Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity
cortest.bartlett(mydata)
#Small values (8.84e-290 < 0.05) of the significance level indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with our data.
det(cor(mydata))
#We have a positive determinant, which means the factor analysis will probably run.

#We can use the parallel() function from the nFactors package (Raiche & Magis, 2020) to perform a parallel analysis.
